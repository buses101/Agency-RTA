    <p>The Riverside Transit Agency (RTA), established in 1975, is the primary transit provider for western Riverside County, California. <br> RTA operates a comprehensive network of services, including 32 local routes, three CommuterLink express routes, on-demand GoMicro microtransit service, and Dial-A-Ride services. <br>
 
RTAâ€™s fleet consists of 339 vehicles, primarily powered by compressed natural gas (CNG) to promote cleaner air. <br> The agency serves a population of over one million people and is funded by various sources, including the Federal Transit Administration and the California Department of Transportation. <br>

RTA is governed by a board of directors comprising 22 elected officials from 18 cities in western Riverside County and four members of the County Board of Supervisors. <br> The agency is committed to providing safe, reliable, and accessible transportation options for all residents in its service area.</p>
